# Simple Port Scanner

Overview:
This project involves creating a port scanning tool used to probe a target system or network to identify which ports are open and listening for connections. This project introduces beginners to key cybersecurity concepts like networking, sockets, and TCP/UDP communication while strengthening Python skills.

Project Goals:
● Learn to use Python's socket module.
● Understand the basics of port scanning and network security.
● Develop a simple tool to scan for open ports on a target system.
● Understand the concept of open ports and why securing them is critical.

Features of the Port Scanner:
1. Accepts a target IP address or hostname.
2. Allows the user to specify a range of ports to scan.
3. Scans for open TCP or UDP ports.
4. Prints the results (open ports) in a user-friendly format.
5. Retrieve and display service banners for open ports.
6. Save scan results to a file for later analysis.
7. Add functionality to ping a range of IPs to discover live hosts.
8. Speed up scanning by checking multiple ports simultaneously (Multi-Threading).
